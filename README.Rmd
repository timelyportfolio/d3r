### Installing d3r

`d3r` is on CRAN, so install with `install.packages("d3r")` or for the absolute latest use `devtools`.

```
devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/d3r")
```

### d3 Dependency Functions

`d3r` makes `d3.js` dependency injection in R easy with `d3_dep_v3()`, `d3_dep_v4()`, `d3_dep_v5()`, `d3_dep_v6()`, and the newest `d3_dep_v7()`.  These functions work well with `htmltools::tags`.

```
library(htmltools)
library(d3r)

# check web developer tools to see d3 is available
browsable(
  attachDependencies(
    tagList(),
    d3_dep_v7()
  )
)

# or include directly in a taglist; I prefer this method.
browsable(
  tagList(
    h1("I have d3 version ", span(id="version")),
    tags$script("d3.select('#version').text(d3.version)"),
    d3_dep_v7()
  )
)
```

Also, I will commit to keeping `d3r` up-to-date with `d3.js`, so you'll no longer need multiple copies of `d3.js` for your `htmlwidgets`.  If you are a `htmlwidget` author, you will no longer need to worry every time `d3.js` gets a new release.  See `treebar` [lines](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/treebar/blob/master/R/treebar.R#L66-L74) for an example of using `d3r` with your `htmlwidget`.

### d3 Hierarchy from data.frame

Building `d3.js` hierarchies can be very difficult.  `d3r::d3_nest()` will convert `table` and `data.frame` to a nested `d3.js` hierarchy ready for work with [`d3-hierarchy`](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy).

```
d3_nest(as.data.frame(Titanic))
```

As another example, let's go from `treemap` to `d3.js`.

```
library(treemap)
library(d3r)

d3_nest(
  treemap::random.hierarchical.data(),
  value_cols = "x"
)
```

### d3 Hierarchy from partykit / rpart

`rpart` and similar objects in `R` are very difficult to convert but make perfect subjects for `d3` hierarchical layouts.  `d3_party` helps convert these objects for easy usage with `d3.js`.

```
#devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/d3treeR")

library(d3treeR)
library(d3r)

# example from ?rpart
data("kyphosis", package="rpart")
rp <-  rpart::rpart(
  Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start,
  data = kyphosis
)

# get the json hierarchy
d3_party(tree=rp)

# interactive plot with d3treeR
d3tree2(
  d3_party(tree=rp),
  celltext="description",
  valueField="n"
)
```

### d3 Network from igraph

`igraph` to `d3.js` network of `nodes` and `links` is a very common conversion.  `d3r::d3_igraph` will do this for you.

```
library(igraph)
library(d3r)

d3_igraph(igraph::watts.strogatz.game(1, 50, 4, 0.05))
```

### Todo

I have a whole lot of ideas.  Please let me know yours, and let's make this package great.
