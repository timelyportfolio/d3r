### Why d3r?

I tried to explain the purpose of `d3r` in this Building Widgets blog post [Why d3r?](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2016/8/28/why-d3r).

### Installing d3r

`d3r` is not on CRAN, so install with `devtools`.

```
devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/d3r")
```

### d3 Dependency Functions

`d3r` makes `d3.js` dependency injection in R easy with two functions `d3_dep_v3()` and `d3_dep_v4()`.  These functions work well with `htmltools::tags`.

```
library(htmltools)
library(d3r)

# check web developer tools to see d3 is available
browsable(
  attachDependencies(
    tagList(),
    d3_dep_v4()
  )
)
```

Also, I will commit to keeping `d3r` up-to-date with `d3.js`, so you'll no longer need multiple copies of `d3.js` for your `htmlwidgets`.  If you are a `htmlwidget` author, you will no longer need to worry every time `d3.js` gets a new release.  See `treebar` [lines](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/treebar/blob/master/R/treebar.R#L66-L74) for an example of using `d3r` with your `htmlwidget`.

### d3 Hierarchy from data.frame

Building `d3.js` hierarchies can be very difficult.  `d3r::d3_nest()` will convert `table` and `data.frame` to a nested `d3.js` hierarchy ready for work with the [`d3-hierarchy`](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy).

```
d3_nest(as.data.frame(Titanic))
```

As another example, let's go from `treemap` to `d3.js`.

```
library(treemap)
library(d3r)

d3_nest(
  treemap::random.hierarchical.data(),
  value_cols = "x"
)
```

### d3 Network from igraph

`igraph` to `d3.js` network of `nodes` and `links` is a very common conversion.  `d3r::d3_igraph` will do this for you.

```
library(igraph)
libary(d3r)

d3_igraph(igraph::watts.strogatz.game(1, 50, 4, 0.05))
```

### Todo

I have a whole lot of ideas.  Please let me know yours, and let's make this package great.
